            <h2>Comments and Text Blocks</h2>

            <p>Comments are used to add additional information to pages that helps developers working on that code. You can also use a comment to hide content from your page.</p>

            <p><em>Marking up text</em> in blocks usually involves using paragraph tags to contain multi-line text. These paragraphs can include emphasized words, highlighted text, and other inline elements.</p>

            <p>It may happen that you have text, like a poem, that requires special formatting. In that case, you may use line break tags. Below is an example from <cite>The Raven</cite> by Edgar Allen Poe:</p>

                <h3>Excerpt from The Raven</h3>

                <p>
                    Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,<br>
                    Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,<br>
                    As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.<br>
                    “'Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only this and nothing more."
                </p>

            <h2>Marking Up Text to Convey Meaning</h2>

            <p>Sometimes you mark up small pieces of text—like single letters or words—to convey meaning. For example, if your page offered search results, you might <mark>highlight</mark> the words the user searched for within the content.</p>

            <p>The primary <mark>focus area</mark> must be chosen from one of the four GIT focus areas. The secondary focus area can be any topic that supports a student’s career path.</p>

            <p>We used the <b>b</b> and <i>i</i> tags above, but not the <u>u</u> tag. These underline text and can confuse users since links often appear underlined. However, they may be used to mark <mark>speling</mark> errors.</p>

        <!-- SECTION 3 -->
        <section>
            <p>Below are some examples of inline <code>HTML</code> tags you’ve learned in this module:</p>

            <p>The <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> tag is used to group introductory content.</p>

            <p>The <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> tag organizes related thematic blocks of content.</p>

            <p>You can format snippets of code using the <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tag, like <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>.</p>
